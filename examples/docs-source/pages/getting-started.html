            You have two options to run and use coal, by downloading an OS optimized release, or by building from
            source.

    <h2>
        Starting a Coal project
    </h2>
    <p>
        First, install or build Coal using the instructions below. Next, take a look at <a
            href="https://github.com/camsjams/rust-coal/tree/main/examples">examples</a> and read up on the <a
            href="/cli/">Command-line interface (CLI)</a>, <a href="/layouts/">Layouts</a>, <a href="/pages/">Pages</a>,
        and <a href="/layouts/">Assets</a>
    </p>

    <h2>Coal via release channel (recommended)</h2>
    <p>
        By downloading a release binary, you do not need Rust installed. Find Coal for your OS on the <a
            href="https://github.com/camsjams/rust-coal/releases">releases page here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Once installed using Operating System specific directions below, use Coal as normal, see <a href="/cli/">CLI</a>
        for more info.</p>
    <h6>Linux, Mac</h6>
    <p>Copy the binary into a directory of your choice, below we copy into <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.</p>
    <pre>
        sudo cp coal /usr/local/bin/coal
    </pre>

    <h6>Windows</h6>
    <p>Copy the coal.exe into a folder that is already on the <code>PATH</code>, or add it to a new folder and register
        that new folder to your <code>PATH</code>.</p>
    <pre>
        sudo cp coal /usr/local/bin/coal
    </pre>

    <h2>Coal via Cargo</h2>
    <h5>
        Prerequisites
    </h5>
    <p>
        You will need to have Rust 2018+ stable installed, and Cargo (which is probably likely if you have Rust).
    </p>
    <h5>
        Cargo Install
    </h5>
    <p>The crate for Coal can be installed via the Cargo interface, and will be installed to <code>~/.cargo/bin/</code>.
        If you have Rust installed then this folder is already part of your <code>PATH</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
        $ cargo install coal
    </pre>
    <h5>
        Updating From Cargo
    </h5>
    <p>Check your installed coal version like so:
    </p>
    <pre>
        $ coal --version
    </pre>
    <p>You can update Coal to a new release with the <code>--force</code> flag.
    </p>
    <pre>
        # check your coal version like so:
        $ coal --version
        $ cargo install coal --force
    </pre>

    <h2>Compile Coal from source</h2>
    <h5>
        Prerequisites
    </h5>
    <p>
        You will need to have Rust 2018+ stable installed, we recommend <code>version 1.47.0</code> or higher, but it
        should work on any 2018+ version.
    </p>
    <h5>
        Obtain Source
    </h5>
    <p>The source code for Coal can be downloaded from the <a href="https://github.com/camsjams/rust-coal">git repo on
            GitHub</a>.</p>
    <pre>
        $ git clone git@github.com:camsjams/rust-coal.git
    </pre>
    <h5>
        Running From Source
    </h5>
    <p>You can run Coal directly from the project by using <code>cargo run [MODE] [ARGS]</code>. See <a
            href="/cli/">CLI</a> for more info.
    </p>
    <pre>
        # Use Coal's local development server
        $ cargo run serve my_source
        # Build your Coal project into static HTML for deployment
        $ cargo run build my_source my_destination
    </pre>
    <h5>
        Running From Local Binary
    </h5>
    <p>You can compile Coal into a binary for use on your machine.</p>
    <pre>
        $ cargo build --release
    </pre>
    <p>A binary for Coal will be built in <code>target/release/coal</code>.</p>
    <p>Copy this binary into a directory of your choice, below we copy into <code>/usr/local/bin/</code>.</p>
    <pre>
        sudo cp target/release/coal /usr/local/bin/coal
    </pre>
    <p>Use Coal as normal, see <a href="/cli/">CLI</a> for more info.</p>
    <pre>
        # Use Coal's local development server
        $ coal serve my_source
        # Build your Coal project into static HTML for deployment
        $ coal build my_source my_destination
