## Who is this for?
Those that want to generate a basic static HTML site, with perhaps 1-10 pages, and do not want to maintain layouts, navigation elements, and footers across multiple files.

If you need programmatic components, then it would be better to utilize a more hands-on system like [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [React Static](https://github.com/react-static/react-static), or a Content Management System (CMS) such as [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/).

Just like in a typical [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) solution, the static HTML output can be easily served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting), and a number of other places. Also see about upcoming Docker support below.
